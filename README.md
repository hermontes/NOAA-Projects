# NOAA-Website-Projects
These are the main projects that I worked on during my time at National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. These links do not include an exhaustive list of the many of the sites that I updated on a daily basis and others that I changed from static to responsive pages.


I was part of the Web Team that was responsbile for tranforming these major Santuary sites to responsive, mobile friendly sites. Below are the links to the end product.

This is an example of a monthly collection I am tasked of creating, provided with images and materials from the content team.

Every year there's a Marine Art Contest and for 2019, I created a site that announced the winners along with their art from all the differenct categories.
