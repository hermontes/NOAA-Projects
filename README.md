# NOAA-Website-Projects
These are the main projects that I worked on during my time at NOAA. These links do not include many of the sites that I updated on a daily basis and others that I changed from static to responsive pages.

This is the site I created for Get Into Your Sanctuary annual magazine.

This site is a database of Shipwrecks from Civil War through World War II. I was responsible for creating a responsive site that included all the shipwrecks and links to each individual shipwreck page.

Every year there's a Marine Art Contest and for 2019, I created a site that announced the winners along with their art from all the differenct categories.
